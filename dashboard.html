      Introduction The Document Object Model (DOM) is a document programming API
      for HTML and XML. It defines how documents are accessed and edited, as
      well as their logical structure. The term "document" is used in the DOM
      specification in a broad sense; XML is rapidly being used to represent
      many different kinds of information that may be kept in various systems,
      and most of this would traditionally be considered data rather than
      documents. XML, on the other hand, provides this information as documents,
      and the DOM may be used to manipulate it.

        "Since the turn of the century, websites have progressed dramatically.
        What used to be a network of basic text-based pages has developed into a
        network of carefully created experiences, complete with responsive
        buttons, parallax scrolling, and tailored information. These website
        design aspects don't appear out of anywhere, of course. These strategies
        can be difficult to execute, and they frequently require the
        collaboration of multiple files and programming languages in order to
        create a unified experience. Your website's files must be able to
        communicate with one another in order to create well-designed, engaging
        web pages, and the Document Object Model (or DOM) makes this possible.
        In this article, I'll explain what the Document Object Model is and how
        does it work." To be more exact, it resembles a "forest" that can
        contain multiple trees. Documents do not need to be implemented as a
        tree or grove, and object relationships do not need to be declared in
        any form. In other words, the object model describes the conceptual
        model for the programming interface, which may be implemented in any way
        that a given implementation deems appropriate. We use the term structure
        model to describe a document's tree-like representation in this
        specification. Structural isomorphism is an important property of DOM
        structure models: if two Document Object Model implementations are used
        to construct a representation of the same document, they will produce
        the same structure model, with the exact same objects and relationships.
        The term "Document Object Model" was chosen because it is an "object
        model" in the classic sense: documents are defined using objects, and
        the model incorporates not just a document's structure, but also its
        behaviour and the objects that make it up.

        Introduction The Document Object Model (DOM) is a document programming
        API for HTML and XML. It defines how documents are accessed and edited,
        as well as their logical structure. The term "document" is used in the
        DOM specification in a broad sense; XML is rapidly being used to
        represent many different kinds of information that may be kept in
        various systems, and most of this would traditionally be considered data
        rather than documents. XML, on the other hand, provides this information
        as documents, and the DOM may be used to manipulate it. Programmers can
        utilise the DOM to build and create documents, as well as browse their
        structure and add, update, and delete elements and data. With a few
        exceptions, the Document Object Model can read, alter, delete, or add
        anything found in an HTML or XML document, with the exception that the
        DOM interfaces for the internal and external subsets have not yet been
        described. One of the main goals of the Document Object Model as a W3C
        definition is to provide a common programming interface that can be
        utilised in a wide range of environments and applications. The Document
        Object Model can be used in any programming language. What is DOM? A
        website is made up of HTML documents at its most basic level. The
        browser you're using to access the website is a program that decodes
        HTML and CSS and renders the style, content, and structure into the page
        you see. The browser builds a representation of the document known as
        the Document Object Model in addition to processing the style and
        structure of the HTML and CSS. This paradigm allows JavaScript to access
        the website document's text content and elements as objects. The
        Document Object Model (DOM) is a document-specific programming API. The
        structure of the object model closely resembles that of the documents it
        represents.
